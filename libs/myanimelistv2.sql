(16, 'Yuuta, Takumi, and Shinobu share a six-tatami room apartment with no bath. The rent is low and it\'s perfect for poor college students such as themselves. Shinobu is a mysterious, quirky person, who does things on a whim. Takumi is passionate both in work and love, and Yuuta is a simple person with simple dreams and desires. That is, until he meets Hagumi, a petite girl with enormous amount of talent. Hagumi is fondly called Hagu by Shuuji, who serves as Hagu\'s guardian. Hagu meets Ayumi, nicknamed Ayu, and they become close friends almost instantly. Meanwhile, Ayu falls for one of the boys... The joys of falling in love, the pain of letting go, discovering one\'s self, and finding the courage to move on—these are some of the things that the characters in Hachimitsu to Clover experience as they take part in the play staged by fate.', '23 min per ep', 0, 24, 'Finished Airing', '2005-04-15', '2005-09-27', 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/73923.jpg', 'PG-13 - Teens 13 or older', 'TV', 'Hachimitsu to Clover', 'ハチミツとクローバー', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TN4a0kZuXg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1', 7),
(53, 'Kaoru Hanabishi, a college student who lives alone, met a beautiful but bewildered girl dressed in a kimono at a train station. He volunteered to guide her way to the address she was looking for, which happened to be in his neighborhood, but turned out to be an empty lot. Not knowing what to do next, Kaoru invited the devastated girl to his apartment and asked for any additional clues to her destination. She supplied him with a photo of two children whom Kauru immediately identified as himself and Aoi Sakuraba, his childhood friend. It turned out that the girl in front of him is Aoi Sakuraba herself, his betrothed fiancee who came all the way to Tokyo to marry him. Her revelation was not only surprising but also reminded the deepest part of Kaoru\'s memory for why he left the Hanabishi family in the first place.', '23 min per ep', 0, 24, 'Finished Airing', '2002-04-11', '2002-09-26', 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/10172.jpg', 'PG-13 - Teens 13 or older', 'TV', 'Ai Yori Aoshi', '藍より青し', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wyQ6ZAojI8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1', 7),
(66, 'Chiyo Mihama begins her high school career as one of the strangest students in her freshman class—a tiny, 10-year-old academic prodigy with a fondness for plush dolls and homemade cooking. But her homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki, is the kind of person who would hijack a student\'s bike to avoid being late, so \"strange\" is a relative word. There certainly isn\'t a shortage of peculiar girls in Yukari-sensei\'s homeroom class. Accompanying Chiyo are students like Tomo Takino, an energetic tomboy with more enthusiasm than brains; Koyomi Mizuhara, Tomo\'s best friend whose temper has a fuse shorter than Chiyo; and Sakaki, a tall, athletic beauty whose intimidating looks hide a gentle personality and a painful obsession with cats. In addition, transfer student Ayumu Kasuga, a girl with her head stuck in the clouds, fits right in with the rest of the girls—and she has a few interesting theories about Chiyo\'s pigtails! Together, this lovable group of girls experience the ups and downs of school life, their many adventures filled with constant laughter, surreal absurdity, and occasionally even touching commentary on the bittersweet, temporal nature of high school.

When Haruhi laments about the lack of intriguing clubs around school, Kyon inspires Haruhi to form her own club. As a result, the SOS Brigade is formed, a club which specializes in all that is the supernatural. Much to his chagrin, Kyon, along with the silent bookworm, Yuki Nagato, the shy and timid Mikuru Asahina, and the perpetually smiling Itsuki Koizumi, are recruited as members. The story follows the crazy adventures that these four endure under their whimsical leader, Haruhi. The story is based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa.

It turns out that the stoic programmer had come across the dragon the previous night on a drunken excursion to the mountains, and since the mythical beast had nowhere else to go, she had offered the creature a place to stay in her home. Thus, Tooru had arrived to cash in on the offer, ready to repay her savior\'s kindness by working as her personal maidservant.
